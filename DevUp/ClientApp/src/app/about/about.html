                <h1>About DEV</h1>
                <p>
                    DEV is a community of software developers getting together to help one another out. The software
                    industry relies on collaboration and networked learning. We provide a place for that to happen.

                    Our application is open source, meaning you can inspect every little detail of the code, or chip in
                    yourself! We are working to make our platform available for anyone to stand up similar communities
                    in any niche or passion.

                    We believe in transparency and adding value to the ecosystem. We hope you poke around and like what
                    you see!
